# Form Builder Demo

A simplified demonstration of how no-code app works in one page

## How it works

1. Pro user design form schema
2. Store form schema (may be actually into database)
3. Render designed form from schema to end user
4. User fill-in the form and the data is collected

## Form Controls

* Text
* Select
* Checkbox

## Technology

* [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) for drawing form from json-schema
* [react-codemirror2](https://github.com/scniro/react-codemirror2) for json viewer
